# Chitter - Front End SPA

## About

Chitter is a web app that allows users to register, sign in and post short messages ('peeps') to a public feed. It mimics the basic functionality of Twitter. This version will have an extended functionality: giving users the ability to 'like' peeps.

## How to run

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`

## Tech stack
React.js

## Work in progress
This project is very much WIP. At the moment the front-end single page app (SPA) loads the 'peep' feed from the Makers' backend, and that's about it.
